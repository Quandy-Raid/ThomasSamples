    <h3>We'll help you find the best fit!</h3>
    <p>The Shoe Store was established in 2006 with one goal in mind: to help our customers find the best fit for a running shoe. It is our belief that running shoes 
    should fit properly, be comfortable and make you feel fast.</p>

    <p>You want spikes? <strong>We got it.</strong> You want a daily trainer? <strong>We got it.</strong> We promise we will never cut corners or compromise on quality. 
    We are proud of our combined 75 years of running shoe experience. All of out fitters are life-long runners and provide coaching services on the side. They literally 
    eat, sleep & drink running. With every step, you'll feel the difference that sets us apart from our competitors. Trust us, you'll come running back!</p>

    <p>If you're not completely satisfied, we will refund your purchase and help you find a shoe to help you meet your goals.</p>
