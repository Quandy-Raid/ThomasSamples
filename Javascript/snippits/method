//built-in methods are pieces of functionality within the javascript language. 
//The alert method creates a pop-up box on the page.

//var name1 = "Jimmy"

//alert("Welcome to my site!");
//alert(name1+"! You are our millionth visitor!")


//prompt takes a result and assigns it to a variable to be used later

//var firstName = prompt("What is your first name?");
//console.log("Hello "+firstName);
//alert("Welcome "+firstName+'!')
//firstName


//Console.log will just write something to the console. When in Visual Studio Code, console.log will actually print to the console
//console.log("Tom")


//document.write writes directly to the webpage
//document.write("It's almost lunch");
//document.write("<h1 style='color:green;'>"+"It's almost lunch, "+name1+'!')


var name='Bob';
var age=36;
var speak='WOOF!';
//var text="Fred said, \""+name+"\'s real age is "+age+" and his dog said '"+speak+"'";

//console.log(text);





//template literals allow you to literally build your string using ${var} to represent variables.

var text=`Fred said, "${name}'s real age is ${age} and his dog said'${speak}'`


console.log(text)
