//coercion allows us to compare values and not worry about types.
//1=='1' is true
//1=='1a' is false

//Javascript coerces false to 0 and true as 1
//so 1==true is true
//0==true is false
//0==false is true


//strict equality (with "===") 
//so 1==='1' is false because the number on right is a string
//also, console.log(1==='1') is false
//and, console.log(0==='0') is false
